# Cutting Traffic

This project was developed for the "Sound of Silence" challenge at QHack 2024, focusing on solving optimization problems with quantum computing using various technique to reduce the qubit count like circuit cutting. We applied the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to tackle the "maxcut" and "max weight cycle" problem, demonstrating quantum computing's potential in addressing complex optimization tasks.

The main project file is `sound_of_silence.ipynb` which contains the code for the QAOA implementation and the results of the optimization. You can run it using the devcontainer provided in the repository.
